#cVim Help
#cVimrc

 * Boolean cVimrc settings are enabled with the command ```'set' + <SETTING_NAME>``` and disabled with<br>
   the command ```'set' + no<SETTING_NAME>``` (for example, ```set regexp``` and ```set noregexp```)
 * Boolean cVimrc settings can be inversed by adding "!" to the end
 * Other settings are defined with ```=``` used as a separator and are prefixed by ```let``` (for example, ```let hintcharacters="abc"```)

###Example configuration
```viml
" Settings
set nohud
set nosmoothscroll
set noautofocus
set typelinkhints
let searchlimit = 30
let scrollstep = 70
let barposition = "bottom"
let locale = "uk" "Current choices are 'jp' and 'uk'. This allows cVim to use sites like google.co.uk or google.co.jp to search rather than google.com. Support is currently very limited. Let me know if you need a different locale for one of the completion/search engines
let hintcharacters = "abc123"
let searchengine dogpile = "http://www.dogpile.com/search/web?q=%s" "If you leave out the '%s' at the end of the URL, your query will be appended to the link. Otherwise, your query will replace the '%s'.
let completionengines = ["google", "amazon", "imdb", "dogpile"]
let searchalias g = "google" "Create a shortcut for search engines. For example, typing ':tabnew g example' would act the same way as ':tabnew google example'
let qmark a = ["http://www.reddit.com", "http://www.google.com", "http://twitter.com"]  "Open all of these in a tab with `gnb` or open one of these with <N>goa where <N>
let blacklists = ["https://mail.google.com/*", "*://*.reddit.com/*"]

" Mappings

map j scrollUp "This remaps the default 'j' mapping
map gb :buffer<Space> "You can use <Space>, which is interpreted as a literal " " character, to enter buffer completion mode
unmap k "The unmaps the default 'k' mapping

map f F "This remaps the default 'f' mapping to the current 'F' mapping

map <C-h> :set hud!<CR> "Toggle the current HUD display value
map <C-i> :set numerichints!<CR> "Switch between alphabetical hint characters and numeric hints
map <C-u> rootFrame
map <M-h> previousTab
map <C-d> scrollPageDown
map <C-e> scrollPageUp
iunmap <C-y> deleteWord
imap <C-m> deleteWord
map X :execute gTx<CR> "Close the current tab and move to the one before it
```

###Blacklists
 * You can blacklist specific commands on chosen domains by adding the keybinding after the blacklist URL. For instance, if you want smooth scrolling enabled with the &lt;Up&gt; and &lt;Down&gt; keys, but not on pages like Chrome's built-in PDF viewer (in which the up and down keys won't respond if they have been mapped), your cVimrc would look like this:
```viml
map <Up> scrollUp
map <Down> scrollDown
```
and the blacklists setting would have look like this:
```viml
let blacklists = ["*://*/*.pdf <Up> <Down>"]
```
 * The blacklists setting uses a custom inplementation of Chrome's @match pattern guidelines. See https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns for a description of the syntax.

###Mappings
 * Normal mappings are defined with the following structure: ```map <KEY> <MAPPING_NAME>```
 * Insert mappings use the same structure, but use the command "imap" instead of "map"
 * Control, meta, and alt can be used also:
```viml
<C-u> "Ctrl + u
<M-u> "Meta + u
<A-u> "Alt  + u
```
 * It is also possible to unmap default bindings with ```unmap <KEY>``` and insert bindings with ```iunmap <KEY>```
 * To unmap all default keybindings, use ```unmapAll```. To unmap all default insert bindings, use ```iunmapAll```

#Tips

 * You can specify whether you activate the tab (:tabnew, :bookmarks, :history, etc) by appending an ampersand (&) to the end of the url
 * You can use @% in "open" commands to specify the current URL. For example, ":open @%" would essentially refresh the current page.
 * Prepend a number to the command to repeat that command N times
 * Use the up/down arrows in command/find mode to navigate through previously executed commands/searches -- you can also use this to search for previously executed commands starting with a certain combination of letters (for example, entering "ta" in the command bar and pressing the up arrow will search command history for all matches beginning with "ta"
